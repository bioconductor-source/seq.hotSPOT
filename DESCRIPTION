Description: seq.hotSPOT provides a resource for designing effective sequencing panels to 
    help improve mutation capture efficacy for ultradeep sequencing projects. Using SNV datasets, this package designs custom
    panels for any tissue of interest and identify the genomic regions likely to contain the most mutations. Establishing efficient
    targeted sequencing panels can allow researchers to study mutation burden in tissues at high depth without the 
    economic burden of whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing. This tool was developed to make high-depth sequencing panels
    to study low-frequency clonal mutations in clinically normal and cancerous tissues.
